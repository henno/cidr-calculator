# CIDR Calculator

A simple tool to calculate and visualize network details from an IP address and CIDR prefix.

- **Input:** Enter the four octets of an IP address and a CIDR prefix.
- **Output:** Displays the network address, broadcast address, host range, and a list of host addresses.
- **Visualization:**
    - Binary view with network bits in gray and host bits in red.
    - Partial octets use both colors to indicate mixed network/host bits.

To use the calculator, just open the `index.html` file in your browser, input the IP and CIDR, and the results update automatically.
